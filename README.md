ASCII table
===========

A small command-line Java application for generating a table of ASCII code and related information.

This project came about because I was unable to find a good quality ASCII reference table that contained the information I needed on a frequent/occasional basis, including:

* ASCII codes in both denary and hexadecimal
* Control characters for commandline entry
* HTML character entity references (which I still need occasionally)
* The Unicode aliases

I have used authoritative sources for the table information so any errors or omissions are mine.

I am sharing the code because it may prove useful to someone who wants to derive a similar table. It is licensed under an [Apache 2.0 Licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomgibara/ascii-table/master/LICENSE). It may also be useful to someone who's looking to learn how to use the Apache Batik library, though the code itself has been put together fairly hastily. 

Generated output is licensed under a Creative Commons 'Attribution-ShareAlike' licence. See [the wiki](https://github.com/tomgibara/ascii-table/wiki) for details.

Finally, here's the table the application generates as a PNG.

The table is also generated in SVG for high quality reproduction. Again, see [the wiki](https://github.com/tomgibara/ascii-table/wiki) for links.
